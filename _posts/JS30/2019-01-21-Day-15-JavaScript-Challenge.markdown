This challenge is about LocalStorage and event delegation!

We will make a tapas menu where you can add/delete items and check or uncheck them. Also, when the page is refreshed,
the local storage will persist the state of the data.

Event delegation is when we add a single event handler to a parent element in ordedr to avoid having to add event handlers 
to multiple child elements.
