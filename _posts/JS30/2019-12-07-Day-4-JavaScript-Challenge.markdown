Nothing pretty here. Not dealing with CSS and not really dealing with DOM elements.

We are dealing with the fundamentals of JavaScript, working with Array methods. Such as filter, map, sort
reduce.

Note worth mentioning. querySelector can be called on any existing DOM element. Doesn't always 
have to be on the Document object. It can look inside of an existing element which we have defined.
(shown in Ex 6).

Great exercise to teach the Array methods, however, I intend to spend some more time learning these methods as 
they can be a little tricky to get the hang of. Especially reduce!
