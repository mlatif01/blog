This was a very exciting challenge! I had to build a custom HTML5 video player using vanilla JS.

I learnt that there are a lot of events which you can add event listeners to such as, play, pause, timeupdate.
There are a lot happening behind the scenes when implementing a HTML video player. Such as having functions to
 update the buttons, toggling play/pause of the video and handling the update of the progress bar.
