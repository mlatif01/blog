Had a few days off because of a cold! Back on track with the course now. I hope!

Today we mess around with CSS Flexbox. Mozilla MDN explains this well, much better than I can be
bothered to right now ;). [here] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
This YT video is also really good at explaining it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GaHn08BXQw)

Repo here [here](https://github.com/mlatif01/js30) 
and demo is [here](http://ml-js30.epizy.com/day05.html).

JS code snippet below:
{% highlight javascript %}

    const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel');

    function toggleOpen() {
      this.classList.toggle('open');
    }

    function toggleActive(e) {
      if (e.propertyName.includes('flex')) {
        this.classList.toggle('open-active');
      }
    }

    panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('click', toggleOpen));
    panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('transitionend', toggleActive));


{% endhighlight %}
