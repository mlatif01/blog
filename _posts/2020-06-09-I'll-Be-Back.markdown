I've currently had a lot of freelance projects which I need to work on. I've been advancing my
knowledge of JS and React through these projects. Also whilst going through Tyler Mcginnis and Frontend 
Master's courses which are awesome.

Clearly I have taken a break from this blog. But I hope to add some more posts when I get some free time. I felt 
kind of guilty for not completing the last 9 days of JS30 XD. I will definitely be doing this when I get 
some more time.

There is also a JS project building course by Traversy Media which I intend to blog about.

Anyways, the point of this post really is to remind myself that I need to finish these projects and to 
also to make it clear that I haven't been lazy ^_^, just really busy building my portfolio with other projects.

Probably no one will read this, but either way I enjoy brain dumping on here :).
