So this is day 1 of the [30 day JavaScript challenge](https://javascript30.com/).

For this challenge I have to build a JavaScript drum kit!

When you hit a corresponding key, it will play the sound associated with that key and it will 
perform a short animation to signify that the button is pressed.
